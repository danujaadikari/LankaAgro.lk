## Login page

A simple standalone login page was added for local testing:

- File: `login.html`
- Styles: `assets/css/login.css`
- Client JS: `assets/js/login.js`

How to try locally: open `login.html` in your browser (double-click or `File -> Open`). The page uses client-side validation and a simulated login flow — replace the simulated part in `assets/js/login.js` with your API call when integrating.
